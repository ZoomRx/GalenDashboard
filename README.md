## Data Refresh

The dashboard displays when data was last refreshed. This timestamp:
- Shows real-time status of data freshness
- Expires after 12 hours to prevent confusion from stale timestamps
- Is updated automatically when new data is loaded

You can refresh data manually using the "Refresh Data" button in the dashboard interface.
